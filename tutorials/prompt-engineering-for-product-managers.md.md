## 🤖 What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the art and science of crafting effective inputs for AI models to produce desired outputs. Think of it as **UX design for AI** — you’re designing *how* the AI understands and responds.

## 🛠️ Why PMs Should Care

You don’t need to write ML models, but you **do** need to:
- Define AI-driven user stories.
- Collaborate with devs/data scientists on outputs.
- Prototype or test AI-based features.
- Troubleshoot “why the AI said that.”
