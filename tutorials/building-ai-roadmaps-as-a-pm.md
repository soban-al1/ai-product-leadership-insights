# 🗺️ Building AI Roadmaps as a Product Manager

AI features don’t follow typical product timelines. They need **experimentation, data training, iteration**, and cross-functional alignment. As a Product Manager, your roadmap must reflect this complexity — while still being outcome-focused and user-first.

## 🧩 Step 1: Define the Problem, Not the Model

Don’t start with “Let’s use GPT-4.” Start with:
- “We want to reduce support load by 30%.”
- “We want to personalize onboarding for 3 key user segments.”

Let the **problem lead** the solution — not the buzzword.

## 🔍 Step 2: Break Down AI Work into Product Milestones

AI work involves phases:

| Milestone                  | Description                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Feasibility Check       | Do we have the right data?                |
| 🧪 Prototype               | Build a fast POC to test assumptions      |
| 🧠 Model Training / Tuning | AI experts handle this                    |
| 🛠️ Integration             | Make the model work within your UX flows  |
| 📈 Experimentation         | A/B test and tune                        |
| 🚀 Go Live + Monitor       | Launch and observe                        |

## 🤝 Step 3: Align Stakeholders Differently

AI roadmaps need **more frequent stakeholder buy-in**, especially from:
- Data Science
- Engineering
- Compliance
- Customer Ops

Set expectations that outcomes are iterative — not instant.

## 🛡️ Step 4: Plan for Risks

AI features can hallucinate or bias. Always:
- Include fallback UX (e.g., "Talk to a human")
- Track and log edge cases
- Communicate that it's *assistance*, not gospel

---

## 🎯 Final Thought

AI Roadmaps are less about "when is it done?" and more about "how do we continuously make it smarter?"  
As a PM, your role is to **de-risk** the journey — and lead it with curiosity, clarity, and user obsession.
